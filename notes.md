Socket.io library for websockets : Bidirectional and low-latency communication for every platform


- project intialization 
- file kaise serve krni hai 
- socket ka integration express app mein kaise krna hai 
- emitting event , broadcasting 

---------------------------------------------------


1. Nodemon: A tool that automatically restarts your Node.js server whenever you make file changes.

    - Speeds up development by removing the need to manually restart the server.

2. CORS (with Express) : Stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

    - Allows or restricts cross-domain API requests (e.g., frontend on localhost:3000 calling backend on localhost:5000).

3. Socket.IO: A library for real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server.
    
    - Chat apps, live notifications, games, etc.


4. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to build backend APIs and web servers easily and efficiently.


     - Simplifies routing (GET, POST, etc.)

      - Easy to handle middleware (e.g., cors, body-parser)

      - Works well with templating engines, databases, and REST APIs

      - Perfect for building RESTful APIs, web apps, or microservices




- SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) is a super-fast JavaScript/TypeScript compiler and bundler written in Rust.  

   - alternative to Babel or Webpack in modern frontend frameworks like Next.js.


- Features

     - Written in Rust â†’ Extremely fast performance.

     - Transpiles JavaScript and TypeScript to browser-compatible code.

     - Supports modern JavaScript (ES6+) features.

     - Used internally by frameworks like Next.js for faster builds.

     - Minifying and bundling JavaScript for production.


- client API mein CDN link se bhi kr skte hai by importing the script ( for socket.io client )
